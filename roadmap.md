Katalyst Calendar Web App - Complete Development Roadmap
I've created a comprehensive roadmap for building the Katalyst Calendar Web App that covers all the core requirements. This project will showcase your technical expertise across frontend, backend integration, and deployment while staying within the 5-6 hour scope.

Katalyst Calendar App - Development Timeline (5-6 hours total)
Project Overview
The Katalyst Calendar Web App is a sophisticated calendar management system that integrates with Google Calendar using Composio's Model Context Protocol (MCP) for real-time calendar data. The application features a modern React TypeScript frontend styled with Tailwind CSS, with a mock AI summary feature for past meetings. The entire application will be deployed on Vercel.

Technical Architecture
Katalyst AI Calendar App - System Architecture Overview
The application follows a three-layer architecture:

- Implement analytics
- Create deployment configuration

Testing & Documentation
- Add basic test coverage
- Create documentation
- Prepare for deployment

Key Technical Implementations
Authentication System
The app uses Google OAuth 2.0 integrated through Composio's managed authentication system. This provides secure user authentication without the complexity of managing OAuth flows directly.

MCP Integration Strategy
Composio's MCP (Model Context Protocol) provides a standardized way to access Google Calendar data. This approach is superior to direct API integration as it handles authentication, rate limiting, and provides a consistent interface.

Meeting Display Features
- Real-time display of 5 upcoming and 5 past meetings with automatic updates
- Comprehensive meeting details: title, time, duration, attendees, and description
- Interactive mock AI summary button for past meetings with placeholder content
- Manual refresh capability with loading states
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

Database Design
Supabase PostgreSQL stores meeting metadata and user preferences. Row Level Security ensures each user only accesses their own data.

Performance Optimization
- React components use proper memoization and lazy loading
- Calendar data is cached to reduce API calls
- Tailwind CSS is purged for minimal bundle size
- Vercel's edge network provides global performance

Competitive Advantages
This implementation demonstrates several advanced technical concepts:

MCP Integration: Using cutting-edge Model Context Protocol instead of traditional REST APIs

Modern Next.js Patterns: Server Components, Server Actions, and TypeScript for maintainable code

Serverless Architecture: Fully serverless deployment with global edge distribution

Security Best Practices: OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and Row Level Security

Success Metrics
Performance: Sub-2 second load times for calendar data

User Experience: Intuitive interface with proper loading states

Reliability: 99%+ uptime with proper error handling

Security: No security vulnerabilities in authentication flow

This roadmap positions you to deliver a production-ready application that showcases modern development practices and scalable architecture. The 5-6 hour timeline is realistic while delivering all core requirements, demonstrating your ability to prioritize and execute under startup conditions.
